# Bandland 
> Bandland is a web application that allows artists to share music with fans and allows fans to support their favorite artists.

> I am taking an existing codebase of a web application and scaling it to support (a minimum of) 100 requests per second on EC2 using a t2.micro instance. The original codebase was created to handle 100 data records, and I will be scaling it to generate and seed 10M records. This involves refactoring and essentially recreating the database. I will also be building out CRUD API routes that will query and use the new database.
